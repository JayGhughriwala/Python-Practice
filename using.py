# Just practicing of a random module

import random

# random_num = random.randint(1, 10)

# print("The random number is ", random_num)

# rand = random.random(); # this will generate random number between 0 and 1
#
# print("The random number is ", int(rand * 100))

#  Now take from the list

lst = ["Jay","Jack","BMW","AUDI","Mercedes Benz"]
print(random.choice(lst))
